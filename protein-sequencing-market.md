<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Protein Sequencing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Edman Degradation</li><li>Mass Spectrometry</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The protein sequencing market comprises two primary types: Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. Edman degradation is a classical method that sequentially removes amino acids from the N-terminus of a protein, providing precise sequence information but is limited to smaller peptides. In contrast, mass spectrometry offers rapid, high-throughput analysis by measuring the mass-to-charge ratio of ionized protein fragments, allowing for the identification and quantification of larger proteins. Both methods are essential for understanding protein structure and function in various biological applications.</p></p>
