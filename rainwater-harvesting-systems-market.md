<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rainwater Harvesting Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Roof Rainwater Collection</li><li>Surface Rainwater Collection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rainwater harvesting systems encompass two primary market types: roof rainwater collection and surface rainwater collection. Roof rainwater collection involves capturing rainwater from building rooftops, directing it through gutters and downspouts into storage tanks. This method is efficient for urban areas with significant impervious surfaces. In contrast, surface rainwater collection captures runoff from natural landscapes or constructed channels, utilizing ponds or basins to store the water. Both systems promote water conservation, sustainable management, and reduced reliance on traditional water sources.</p></p>
